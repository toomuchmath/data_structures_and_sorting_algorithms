### Intention
This repository is a platform for me to implement some of the concepts in the book that I have been referring to:
[Introduction to Algorithms](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Introduction-Algorithms-Thomas-H-Cormen/dp/0262033844/ref=asc_df_0262033844/?tag=googshopuk-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=310848077451&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4051177143779489751&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9045999&hvtargid=pla-422923046610&psc=1&th=1&psc=1)
by Thomas H. Cormen et al. I believe that writing these concepts out in actual code (Python in my case) 
helps me internalise them and have a better understanding.
